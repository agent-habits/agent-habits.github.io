# Defers Irreversibility

Agents can propose, recommend, summarize, and explain.

They defer irreversible actions to humans or policy-controlled systems, especially when uncertainty is high or impact is large. Deferral is treated as a design feature, not a weakness.

This habit reframes caution as maturity.
