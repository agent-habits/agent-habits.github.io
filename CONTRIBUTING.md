# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project is open source and intentionally curated.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

- Examples of agentic systems that map to existing habits
- Failure analyses and postmortems
- Tools or patterns that support specific habits
- Critiques and limitations grounded in real experience

## What Contributions Are Not

- New habits without strong justification
- Vendor marketing content
- Abstract theory without application

## Editorial Model

The habit definitions are curated and versioned.

The maintainer retains final editorial authority to preserve clarity, continuity, and intent.

Contributions should aim to improve understanding, not expand scope.

## How to Contribute

- Open an issue for discussion
- Submit a pull request with clear context
- Reference the habit your contribution supports or critiques

## Pull Request Guidance

- Create focused PRs with a single intent (typo fix, add example, reorganize a single page).
- Use the following PR template in the description:
	- **Summary:** One-line summary of the change.
	- **Related habit(s):** Which habit(s) this maps to (if any).
	- **Motivation:** Why this improves clarity or adds value.
	- **Notes for reviewers:** Any build or review steps.
