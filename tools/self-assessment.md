# Agent Habits Self-Evaluation Template

This template helps teams reason about how the Agentic Systems Habits apply to their project.

It is not an audit.
It is not a compliance checklist.

The goal is to support clarity, discussion, and incremental improvement.

## How to use this template

Teams typically use this template:

- During design reviews
- After incidents or near-misses
- When introducing new agent capabilities
- As preparation for sharing a project publicly

Answers do not need to be exhaustive.
Concise, honest descriptions are preferred.

# Habit-by-habit reflection

## Habit 1: Clearly Bounded Role

reference: [Habit 1](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-1/)

How is the agent’s role defined?
What problem is it responsible for solving?
What is explicitly out of scope?

Notes:

## Habit 2: Embedded in Workflows

reference: [Habit 2](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-2/)

How is the agent integrated into existing workflows?
What happens before and after the agent acts?

Notes:

## Habit 3: Explicit Constraints

reference: [Habit 3](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-3/)

What constraints are enforced by the system?
Which actions are irreversible or restricted?

Notes:

## Habit 4: Defers When Impact Is High

reference: [Habit 4](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-4/)

When does the agent escalate or defer?
How is uncertainty handled?

Notes:

## Habit 5: System-Level Optimization

reference: [Habit 5](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-5/)

What system-level outcomes does the agent optimize for?
How are local vs global tradeoffs managed?

Notes:

## Habit 6: Accountability Is Visible

reference: [Habit 6](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-6/)

Who owns the outcomes of agent actions?
How are decisions traceable?

Notes:

## Habit 7: Governed by Design

reference: [Habit 7](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-7/)

How are governance principles expressed in architecture?
Where are permissions, escalation paths, and ownership made explicit?

Notes:

# Summary

- Habits currently emphasized:
- Known gaps or risks:
- Planned improvements:

```

## Optional sharing

Teams may choose to share:

- This evaluation publicly
- A summarized version
- A link to relevant architecture documentation

Sharing is encouraged but not required.

## Badge

Teams my choose to include a badge on their project.

## Closing note

The value of this exercise is not the score.

The value is making implicit assumptions explicit.
