# The Seven Habits

The habits below describe recurring patterns observed in agentic systems that reliably create value in production environments.

They are not steps or rules.  
They are lenses for design, evaluation, and governance.

## 1. Clearly Bounded Role
Effective agents serve a narrowly defined function within a larger system.

They reduce ambiguity without owning outcomes end to end.

## 2. Embedded in Workflows
Agents operate inside workflows, not above them.

They translate unstructured input into structured signals that downstream systems can act on.

## 3. Explicit Constraints
Effective agents operate under clearly defined permissions, limitations, and escalation paths.

Constraints are part of the interface, not an implementation detail.

## 4. Defers Irreversibility
Agents can propose, recommend, and explain.

They defer irreversible actions to humans or policy-controlled systems.

## 5. Optimizes for System Outcomes
Agents are evaluated on system-level impact, not local intelligence.

Success is measured in reliability, clarity, and reduced cognitive load.

## 6. Progress Through Structure
As agentic systems mature, structure increases.

Interfaces narrow, permissions tighten, and playbooks become explicit.

## 7. Visible Accountability
Well-designed agentic systems make ownership clearer, not fuzzier.

When accountability decreases, the system is regressing.
