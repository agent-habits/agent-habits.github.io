# Agentic Systems Habits

This repository defines a canonical set of habits observed in agentic systems that reliably create value in real production environments.

The goal of this project is to provide a shared language for engineers, system designers, and executive leaders to reason about where agents belong, how they should behave, and why many agentic initiatives fail despite increasingly capable models.

This is not a tutorial or a framework for building agents.

It is a design lens.

## Core Belief

Effective agentic systems are not autonomous actors.

They are governed components designed to reduce ambiguity, improve decisions, and increase system reliability without replacing accountability.

This belief prioritizes system outcomes over novelty, autonomy, or raw model capability.

## What This Repository Contains

* A stable manifesto defining the philosophy behind effective agentic systems
* A canonical set of seven habits, each defined independently
* Governance principles embedded directly into system design
* Examples, failure modes, and patterns contributed by the community

The habits themselves are intentionally stable. Supporting material beneath them is expected to evolve.

## What This Is Not

This repository is not:

* A step-by-step guide to building agents
* A maturity model or readiness checklist
* A vendor comparison or product endorsement
* A claim of completeness or universal correctness

The habits defined here are opinionated, intentionally scoped, and meant to guide thinking rather than prescribe implementation.

## The Seven Habits

1. [Clearly Bounded Role](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-1)
2. [Embedded in Workflows](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-2)
3. [Explicit Constraints](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-3)
4. [Defers Irreversibility](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-4)
5. [Optimizes for System Outcomes](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-5)
6. [Progress Through Structure](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-6)
7. [Visible Accountability](https://agent-habits.github.io/habits/habit-7)

Each habit includes intent, scope, governance implications, common failure modes, and examples.

## Governance Philosophy

Governance is treated as a design property, not a compliance layer.

In this framework, governance emerges through:

* Explicit scope
* Clear permission boundaries
* Designed escalation paths
* Inspectable accountability

A system that becomes less governable as it becomes more intelligent is not improving.

## Agent Habits Badge

Projects that align with this framework may display the Agent Habits badge to signal intentional design and governance of agentic systems.

The badge represents participation in a shared vocabulary and set of design habits, not certification or compliance.

## Open Source and Contributions

This project is open source and intentionally curated.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:

* Real-world examples
* Failure analyses and postmortems
* Tools or patterns that support existing habits
* Thoughtful critiques grounded in experience

The habit definitions themselves are curated and versioned to preserve clarity and continuity. The maintainer retains final editorial authority.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
