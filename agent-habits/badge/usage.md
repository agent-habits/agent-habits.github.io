# Using the Agent Habits Badge

This page explains how to use the Agent Habits badge in your project and what is expected when doing so.

## Badge image

The canonical badge is available as an inline SVG:

<https://agent-habits.github.io/assets/badges/agent-habits-badge.svg>

![Agent Habits Badge](https://agent-habits.github.io/assets/badges/practices-agent-habits.svg)

## Recommended usage

The badge is typically placed:

- In a project README
- On a documentation site
- On an architecture or governance page

It should link back to the Agent Habits badge page so readers can understand its meaning.

Example Markdown usage:

```markdown
[![Supports Effective Agent Habits](https://agent-habits.github.io/assets/badges/practices-agent-habits.svg)](https://agent-habits.github.io/badge/)
```

## When to use the badge

You should use the badge if your project:

- Explicitly considers agent scope and authority
- Defines permission boundaries and escalation paths
- Embeds agents into workflows rather than granting full autonomy
- Treats agent failures as diagnosable system events

You do not need to satisfy every habit fully to participate.

The badge reflects alignment and intent, not perfection.

## Self-assessment and transparency

Badge usage is self-attested.

Projects are encouraged, but not required, to:

- Document which habits they focus on
- Describe known gaps or tradeoffs
- Share lessons learned over time

Transparency strengthens the value of the badge for the community.

## Future evolution

In the future, this project may support:

- Habit-specific badges
- Project listings with habit annotations
- Optional evaluation templates or checklists

Any such evolution will remain opt-in and community-driven.

## Questions or contributions

If you are unsure whether the badge is appropriate for your project, or if you want to contribute improvements, open a discussion or pull request in the repository.
