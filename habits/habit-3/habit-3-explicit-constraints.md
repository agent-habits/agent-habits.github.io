# Explicit Constraints

Effective agents operate under clearly defined permissions, limitations, and escalation paths.

Constraints are part of the interface. They define what the agent may do directly, what requires approval, and what is explicitly forbidden. Without constraints, autonomy becomes ambiguity.

This habit forms the foundation of governance.
