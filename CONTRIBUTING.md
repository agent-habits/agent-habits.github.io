# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agentic Systems Habits project.

This project is open source and intentionally curated. Contributions are welcomed when they improve clarity, practical understanding, and real-world applicability of the habits.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

We actively welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Examples of agentic systems that apply one or more habits in practice
- Case studies, failure analyses, or postmortems grounded in real systems
- Design patterns, tools, or workflows that support specific habits
- Additions to the [Resources page](/docs/resources/index.md), such as articles, projects, or other external links
- Constructive critiques and limitations based on hands-on experience
- Clarifications or refinements that improve precision or readability

Contributions that include concrete examples are especially encouraged.

## What Contributions Are Not

To preserve focus and signal-to-noise ratio, the following are generally not accepted:

- Proposals for new habits without strong justification and evidence
- Vendor marketing or product promotion
- Abstract theory without operational relevance
- Broad rewrites that expand scope without improving clarity

This framework favors depth and precision over breadth.

## How the Framework Evolves

The habit definitions and governance philosophy are curated and versioned.

The maintainer retains final editorial authority to ensure continuity, coherence, and long-term usability. This is not a limitation on contribution, but a design choice to keep the framework legible and stable.

Well-argued critiques are welcome. Changes to core concepts require strong reasoning and practical grounding.

## Ways to Contribute

There are multiple ways to participate, depending on your interests:

### Contribute a Project Example

If your project applies the Agentic Systems Habits, you may submit it and it may be included in the **Projects with Good Habits** page (pending).

Before submitting, we recommend completing the self-evaluation template:

- Self-evaluation template: [Self-Evaluation Template](https://github.com/agent-habits/agent-habits.github.io/tools/self-assessment.md)

You may submit a summarized version of your evaluation rather than the full document.

### Use and Display the Badge

Projects that align with the framework may display the Agent Habits badge.

Badge usage guidelines are available here:
<https://agent-habits.github.io/badge/usage/>

Badge usage is self-attested and does not require approval.

### Contribute Content or Improvements

- Open an issue to discuss ideas or questions
- Submit a pull request with clear scope and context
- Reference the habit or page your contribution supports or critiques

## Pull Request Guidance

Please keep pull requests focused and intentional.

Recommended PR structure:

- **Summary:** One-line description of the change
- **Related habit(s):** Which habit(s) or page this maps to
- **Motivation:** Why this improves clarity or usefulness
- **Notes for reviewers:** Any context, tradeoffs, or review considerations

Small, precise PRs are preferred over large, sweeping changes.

## Community Expectations

- Practical experience
- Respectful discussion

The goal is shared understanding, not consensus.
