# Clearly Bounded Role

Effective agents serve a narrowly defined function within a larger system.

They are designed to reduce ambiguity in a specific domain, not to own outcomes end to end. A bounded role limits blast radius, clarifies expectations, and makes failures observable rather than mysterious.

This habit addresses the most common early mistake in agentic design: assigning broad responsibility without clear purpose.
