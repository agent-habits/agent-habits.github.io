# Agent Habits Badge

The Agent Habits badge signals that a project intentionally designs, evaluates, and operates agentic systems using the Agentic Systems Habits framework.

It is a declaration of design intent, not a certification.

Projects that use this badge commit to reasoning explicitly about agent scope, constraints, deferral, accountability, and governance as their systems evolve.

## What the badge represents

The badge indicates that a project:

- Uses the Agentic Systems Habits as a design and review lens
- Treats agent behavior as a system design concern, not a prompt-only concern
- Explicitly reasons about permissions, escalation, and accountability
- Accepts that agentic systems require structure to scale safely

The badge is intentionally lightweight. It is meant to encourage clarity, not gatekeeping.

## What the badge does not represent

The badge does not mean that a project:

- Has implemented all habits perfectly
- Is formally audited or certified
- Claims best-in-class agentic design
- Avoids all agent failure modes

Agentic systems are evolving. The badge reflects participation in that evolution, not completion.

## How projects typically use the badge

Projects use the badge in different ways:

- As a public signal of design values
- As an internal reminder during system reviews
- As a shared vocabulary across teams
- As a starting point for governance discussions

Some projects adopt the habits incrementally. Others use them to formalize existing practices.

Both approaches are valid.

## Relationship to governance

The badge aligns with the Governance Philosophy of this project.

It reflects the belief that governance is a design property that emerges from how agents are scoped, constrained, and embedded into workflows.

Projects displaying the badge are expected to treat governance as part of system architecture, not an afterthought.

## Participation and evolution

This framework is open and evolving.

Projects are encouraged to:

- Share examples of how they apply the habits
- Contribute refinements or clarifications
- Propose tooling or templates that support habit adoption

The badge exists to foster a community of practice, not to enforce compliance.
