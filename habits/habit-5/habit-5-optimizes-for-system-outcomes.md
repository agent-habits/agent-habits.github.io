# Optimizes for System Outcomes

Effective agents are evaluated on system-level impact, not local intelligence.

Success is measured in reduced cognitive load, improved handoffs, faster resolution, and increased reliability. Clever behavior that degrades the system is not progress.

This habit aligns agent design with organizational outcomes.
