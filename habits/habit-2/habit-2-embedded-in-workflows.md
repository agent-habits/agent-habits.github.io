# Embedded in Workflows

Agents create the most value when they operate inside existing workflows rather than above or outside them.

They translate unstructured input into structured signals that downstream systems, automation, or humans can act on. They do not replace pipelines, policies, or execution engines.

This habit prioritizes integration over replacement.
