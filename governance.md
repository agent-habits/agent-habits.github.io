# Governance Philosophy

Governance is not a layer added after deployment.

In this framework, governance is a design property expressed through scope, constraints, escalation paths, and accountability.

Agentic systems should become more governable as they become more capable.

## Core Principles

- Authority must be explicit
- Irreversible actions require oversight
- Escalation paths must be designed, not implied
- Accountability should be inspectable after the fact

Governance failures are system design failures.

This section will expand as real-world examples, patterns, and tools are added.
